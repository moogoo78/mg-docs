## Quotes

- "Quitting smoking is the easiest thing I've ever done, I've done it hundreds of timess" Mark Twain, [Part1. chap1. section: Aspirations]
- The danger of manupulations is that they work. (Just because it works doesn't make it right) (p.33)
- A WHY is just a belief. That's all it is. HOWs are the actions you take to realize those actions (p.67)
- WHATs don't drive desision-making, WHATs should be used as proof of WHY (p.76)
- "I think it's right." It's more scalable than "I feel it's right." When you know your WHY, the highest level of confidence you can offer is, "I nkow it's right." (p.79)
- We've succeeded as a species because of our ability to form cultures. Cultures are groups of people who come together around a common set of values and beliefs. (p.88)
- Trust comes from being a part of a culture or organization with a common set of values and beliefs. Trust is maintained when the values and beliefs are actively managed. (p.110)
- Passion comes from feeling like you are a part of something that you believe in, something bigger than yourself. (p.111)
- Geoffrey Moore expanded on Rogers's ideas to apply the principle to high-tech product marketing. (p.116)
- We don't want to come to work to build a wall, we want to come to work to build a cathedral. (p.135)
- Most people in the world are HOW-types. (p.141)
- How-types don't need WHY-types to do well. But WHY-guys, for all their vision and imagination, often get the short end of the stick. (p.141)
- For passion to survive, it needs structure. A WHY without the HOWs, passion without structure, has a very high probability of failure. (p.184)
- Cerebral palsy, a condition often caused by complications at birth, affects someone's movement and balance. (p.222)
