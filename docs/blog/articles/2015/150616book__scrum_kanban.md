# [閱讀] Kanban and Scrum

::

    書名: Kanban and Scrum - making the most of both
    作者: Henrik Kniberg & Mattias Skarin
    出版: InfoQ

## 比較

Scrum:

- split your organization
- split your work
- split time
- optimize the release plan
- optimize the process

Kanban:

- visualize the workflow
- measure the lead time (cycle time: average time to complete one item)

宮本武藏雙刀流

- Scrum prescripes roles (Product Owner, Team, Scrum Master)
- Scrum prescribes timeboxed iteration
- Kanban 沒限制

- Kanban limits WIP **per workflow state** (ex: Work state "Doing" 不能超過 2 個)
- Scrum limits WIP **per iteration** (limited per unit of time)
